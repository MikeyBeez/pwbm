# pwbm - Personal WayBack Machine

The goal of pwbm is to make an easy to use appliance which can be fed URLs which it scrapes periodically. The content is saved in a similar manner to the popular "Wayback machine". Howver as this is a 'personal' wayback machine, you control the URLs which are scanned and when. The archive is held locally and can be easily managed.
